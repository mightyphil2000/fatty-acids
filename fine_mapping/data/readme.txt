1. colorectal_cancer_forcoloc.tab: associations of 538 SNPs with risk of colorectal cancer from the GECCO consortium (58221 cases and 67694 controls). 

2. lung_cancer_forcoloc.tab: associations of 538 SNPs with risk of lung cancer from the TRICL/ILCCO consortium (29266 cases and 56450 controls).

3. AA_to_DGLA_forcoloc.tab: Associations of 538 SNPs with AA:DGLA in the FADS genomic region in the CHARGE consortium (Max N=8631). AA = arachidonic acid (20:4n6); DGLA=dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3n6). This ratio is a biomarker of FADS1 enzyme activity.

4. GLA_to_LA_forcoloc.tab: Associations of 538 SNPs with GLA:LA in the FADS genomic region in the CHARGE consortium (Max N=8631). GLA= gamma-linolenic acid (18:3n6) and LA = linoleic acid (18:2n6). This ratio is a biomarker of FADS2 enzyme activity.

5. CHS_LD_forcoloc.ld: This is the correlation matrix for 538 SNPs from the CHS (N=2408). The CHS is one of the cohorts in the CHARGE consortium meta-analysis that generated the results we are using to define AA:DGLA (FADS1) and GLA:LA (FADS2). The CHS represents 28% of the participants in the CHARGE consortium. 

6. CHS_LD_forcoloc.frq: This is a table of the 538 SNP RSids, their genomic coordinates and their frequency in the CHS. The order of the RSids in this file should correspond exactly to the position of RSids in all files as well as rows and columns of the correlation matrix file.


Fine mapping set
7. AA_to_DGLA_fine_mapping.tab
Association between 559 SNPs and AA:DGLA in the FADS genomic region. AA = arachidonic acid (20:4n6); DGLA=dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3n6). This ratio is a biomarker of FADS1 enzyme activity.

8. GLA_to_LA_fine_mapping.tab
Association between 559 SNPs and GLA:LA in the FADS genomic region. GLA= gamma-linolenic acid (18:3n6) and LA = linoleic acid (18:2n6). This ratio is a biomarker of FADS2 enzyme activity.

9. CHS_EA_HRC_LD_11_61043499_62159523_fine_mapping.frq
This is a table of 559 SNP RSids, their genomic coordinates and their frequency in the CHS. The order of the RSids in this file should correspond exactly to the position of RSids in all files as well as rows and columns of the correlation matrix file.

10. CHS_EA_HRC_LD_11_61043499_62159523_fine_mapping.ld
This is the correlation matrix for 559 SNPs from the CHS (N=2408). The CHS is one of the cohorts in the CHARGE consortium meta-analysis that generated the results we are using to define AA:DGLA (FADS1) and GLA:LA (FADS2). The CHS represents 28% of the participants in the CHARGE consortium. I could also send you a correlation matrix based on UK Biobank (N=10,000), if you thought that would be useful?

All files within each set (colocalisation set and fine mapping set) have been harmonised so that the number of SNPs, the ordering of SNPs and SNP effect alleles are consistent across summary association statistics and the CHS correlation matrix.
